# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-System
This project is a effective implementation of a digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset. MNIST, widely known in the machine learning community, consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model to accurately classify and recognize these digits.
